Welcome to my daily training ground for becoming a proficient backend developer! This repository is dedicated to solving real-world, scenario-based JavaScript problems. I believe in learning by doing, and every commit here represents a step forward in my journey.

This isn't just a collection of code; it's a living log of my progress, my thought process, and my solutions to common backend challenges.

üéØ The Goal
The objective of this repository is to:

Practice backend JavaScript concepts daily.

Tackle challenges related to API design, data handling, middleware, asynchronous operations, and more.

Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

Track my learning and improvement over time.

üöÄ Challenge Log
Here you can find the challenges I've worked on, organized by day. Each folder contains the problem description and my solution.

Day 1: RESTful API Basics
‚úÖ 1. API Endpoint Design & Implementation

(...and so on)

Day 2: Intermediate Backend Concepts
[ ] 1. API Key Middleware (In Progress)

[ ] 2. Parallel Asynchronous Fetching

[ ] 3. Advanced Data Validation

[ ] 4. In-Memory API Rate Limiter

[ ] 5. Data Aggregation

(...and more!)

As you create folders for each day (e.g., a "Day2" folder), you can update the links in this section to point directly to them.

Thank you for checking out my work! Feel free to browse the solutions and follow my journey.
